RxJS-Examples
=============

##Requirements
* Node Installed
* NPM Installed

##Starting
* Ready environment: `./install.sh`
* Start server: `node server`
* Build product: `node build`

Then just go to localhost:3000 and navigate to the examples.  All the examples contain some basic information in them
in the form of text comments.

##Contributing
There is still so much to do both for functional displays of RxJS to the build process.  If you do contribute just throw
up a PR and if its good i'll pull it in!

##Future
I would like to incorporate the browserify build system build.json.  I did create it, so there is some dogfood attempts going on here.
